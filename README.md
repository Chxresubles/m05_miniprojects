# M05-MiniProjects
This repository hold 2 ML projects. One for determining of the quality of a wine from their intrinsic properties. The second for predicting the price of a house in Boston from their features.

# Description
Both projects [wine_quality](wine_quality/README.md) and [boston_house_prices](boston_house_prices/README.md) will perform Machine Learning tasks using 2 approaches: Linear Regression and Regression Trees.
Each project has its own dataset included. The references of these datasets can be found in the documentation of the projects.

# Prerequisites
To run these scripts, you must have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed.
