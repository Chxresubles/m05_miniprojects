# Wine Quality
This project is used to determe of the quality of a wine from their intrinsic properties.

# Description
This project will determine the quality of a wine using 2 approaches: Linear Regression and Regression Trees.

# Data sets
The data sets can be found in the [dataset directory](dataset). Both the red and white wine data sets were retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
